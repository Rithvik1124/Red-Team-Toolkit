ðŸš¨ðŸš¨This a Python-based application designed to streamline the process of identifying common vulnerabilities in websites,
by automating tests for SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), HTML Injection, as well as providing domain and subdomain information, 
open ports, and associated services, the toolkit saves time for advanced vulnerability analysis.

## Features

1. **SQL Injection Testing**
   - Identifies SQL injection vulnerabilities by testing various payloads against input fields.

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Testing**
   - Detects XSS vulnerabilities using payloads that attempt to trigger alerts or reflect injected scripts.

3. **HTML Injection Testing**
   - Evaluates the susceptibility of websites to HTML-based payloads.

4. **Domain and Subdomain Information**
   - Retrieves domain registration details and enumerates subdomains.

5. **Port Scanning**
   - Scans for open TCP and UDP ports and identifies running services.

6. **Ping Test**
   - Checks website reachability via ICMP ping.

Before running the application, ensure the following:
       1. Python 3.8 or later is installed.
       2. Required libraries are installed:
            - `selenium`
            - `socket`
            - `whois`
            - `pycrtsh`
            - `dns.resolver`
            - `subprocess`
            - `pyqt6`
